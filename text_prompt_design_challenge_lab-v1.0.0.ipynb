    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge lab is designed to test your knowledge of calling Gemini and utilizing a few fundamental text prompt design techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two featured guides on prompting from the Google Cloud documentation are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Overview of prompting strategies](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/prompt-design-strategies) from the Generative AI on Vertex AI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Prompt design strategies](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-strategies) from the Gemini API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both contain good tips. You are encouraged to **bookmark them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "You will demonstrate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initialize Vertex AI in your environment\n",
    "- Load a generative model\n",
    "- Guide model output with a persona\n",
    "- Extract information to a schema\n",
    "- Stay on topic with fallback responses\n",
    "- Use examples to influence the model's response\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the following Python notebook cells have missing or incomplete code sections and tasks that need to be completed, indicated by the code comments starting with `# TODO`. Your challenge is to complete each cell, run it to test for correctness, and then move on. When all the cells are working, you have completed the challenge.\n",

      "* **Lunges:** This exercise targets your quads, glutes, and hamstrings, as well as your balance. You can do them forward, backward, or sideways.\n",
      "* **Step-ups:** This is a great exercise for building strength and power in your legs. You can use a step, bench, or any elevated surface.\n",
      "* **Calf raises:** This exercise targets your calf muscles. You can do them on your toes, heels, or even with a barbell for additional weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weighted Exercises:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Barbell squats:** This is a weighted version of the classic squat, and it's a great way to build muscle and strength in your legs.\n",
      "* **Leg press:** This machine exercise allows you to target specific muscle groups in your legs, such as your quads or hamstrings.\n",
      "* **Leg extensions:** This exercise isolates your quads and helps to build muscle definition.\n",
      "* **Hamstring curls:** This exercise targets your hamstrings and helps to improve your flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Exercises:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Jumping jacks:** This is a great cardio exercise that also works your legs.\n",
      "* **Burpees:** This full-body exercise is a challenging way to get your heart rate up and work your legs.\n",
      "* **Cycling:** This is a low-impact exercise that is easy on your joints and a great way to strengthen your legs.\n",
      "* **Swimming:** This is another low-impact exercise that is great for your legs and your overall fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Use proper form:** It's important to use proper form when doing any exercise to avoid injury. Watch videos or ask a trainer for guidance.\n",
      "* **Start light and gradually increase the weight:** If you're new to weightlifting, start with a lighter weight and gradually increase it as you get stronger.\n",
      "* **Listen to your body:** Don't push yourself too hard, especially when you're first starting. If you feel pain, stop and rest.\n",
      "* **Warm up before you start and cool down afterwards:** This will help to prevent injury.\n",
